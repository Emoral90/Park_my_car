# Park My Car

## Abstract
A multiplatform Kotlin app to help tourists and visitors find free parking. Park My Car is a mobile application designed to simplify the process of finding and securing parking spots within the town of Rexburg. The app aims to alleviate the common parking-related challenges faced by users, such as circling for parking, paying for parking, and keeping track of their parked vehicle's location. 

## Description
### Why
* The main reasons behind the development of this app are because I have seen the stress and consequences taken upon by fellow students of not paying attention to the parking restrictions and regulations imposed by the university, city, and apartment complexes (when applicable). Another reason is because I have a genuine interest in furthering my learning experience at this school as well as wanting to become more proficient in the Kotlin and Java programming languages for mobile and GIS map programming respectively to broaden my programming and software engineering expertise.

### What
Planned features will include but are not limited to:
1. Real-Time Spot Locator: The app will provide real-time information on available parking spots in your vicinity. Users can easily see where open spots are located on a map.
2. Navigation Assistance: The app will offer GPS-based navigation to guide users to their chosen parking spot or a nearby parking facility.
3. Parking History: Users can keep track of their parking history, including the date, time, and location of their previous parking sessions.
4. Parking Alerts: The app will send notifications to users when their parking time is about to expire (where applicable), helping them avoid parking fines.
5. Reviews and Ratings: Users can rate and review parking spots and facilities, providing valuable feedback to fellow drivers.
6. Safety and Security: The app will include safety features like a "Safe Parking" option that helps users find well-lit and secure parking areas.
7. Reservation System: Users can reserve parking spots in advance, ensuring that they have a guaranteed place to park when they arrive at their destination.
8. Payment Integration: The app will allow users to pay for parking directly through the app, reducing the need for cash or physical payment methods. 

### Who
Target audience will include but is not limited to: Incoming freshmen students to Brigham Young University Idaho, and visitors to the city of Rexburg. A potential secondary audience that could be considered are tourists.

### Where
The app will initially be developed in the Kotlin language on Android Studio to be used on Android devices, and later translated into Swift for Apple devices

### How
It will be intended for quick and convenient use by the end users most likely on their smartphones. Time to search for a desired parking spot shall take no more than 2 minutes 

### When
1. The stage at when this project will be considered complete will be when all the non-highlighted or essential features above are implemented.
2. Integration and user acceptance testing will take place after each essential feature is implemented
3. Data accuracy and collection will be held to real world standards (IEEE Std 12207-2008)
4. Scalability and performance will be maintained throughout development to handle increasingly large amounts of user traffic and data
